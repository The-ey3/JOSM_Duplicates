JOSM is a free software desktop editing tool for OpenStreetMap geodata created in Java, originally developed by Immanuel Scholz and currently maintained by Dirk St√∂cker. The editing tool contains advanced features that are not present in OSM's default online editor.

It supports loading GPX tracks, background imagery, and OSM data from local sources as well as from online sources and allows to edit the OSM data (nodes, ways, and relations) and their metadata tags.

JOSM is open source and licensed under GPL.
